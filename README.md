# ESP8266-driver
Embedded C driver program for ESP8266 WIFI module to communicate with a cloud server.
# What is ESP8266 ?
The ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network.
Each ESP8266 module comes pre-programmed with an AT command set firmware, meaning, you can communicate or use its funcctions by simply sending these AT commands to it and it will give response. The ESP8266 module is an extremely cost effective board with a huge, and ever growing, community.
# Why ESP8266 ?
1. Super cost effective. Just less than Rs.250 .
2. Super integrated. Less than the size of your thumb and so can be embedded into any of your projects.
3. Super simple UART interface.
4. Internal memory and flash memory.
5. GPIO pins.
And much more...

# What does this driver do ?
Once you have embedded and interfaced this ESP8266 chip into your electronics project, you just need to include this driver to your main firmware project and then you need to call ust few simple functions to make your project transfer data to some cloud server that you can mention. All the complex things would be done by this driver in the backend and you can continue thinking beyond that.
# How can you contribute ?
I will be addding details about how to contribute to this project shortly but still you can contribute easily as the code is well-commented. For quickstart just try exploring the source-files folder and skip the other two folders.
